## Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life implemented as a C# console application.  
The game is a **cellular automaton** with four rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (under-population).  
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.  
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (over-population).  
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
